    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa’s most
      popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style
      grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Meat</li>
      <li>Onion and garlic</li>
      <li>Tomato products</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
      <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>Cheeses</li>
      <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic,
        ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth
        and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and
        sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the
        middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.
        Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric;
        continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice
        is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon
        paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer.
        Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer
        for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow
        rice to sit and do not remove the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork,
        separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped
        cilantro.
